Hi there 👋

I’m Immie! a 3rd year Computer Science student who loves learning, coding, and figuring things out one bug at a time 🐛💻

🔭 I’m currently working on school projects and improving my coding skills

🌱 Nowadays, I'm learning web development, Java, and C++, as well as how to be a great DATA ANALYST!

👯 Looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects and friends to help me with leveling up my coding and problem-solving skills
